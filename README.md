**Key insights derived from the analysis include:**

* Peak Sales Months:
> The months of October, November, and December showed significantly higher sales volumes. This trend aligns with the seasonal demand surge due to holiday shopping events such as Black Friday and Christmas.

* Lowest Sales Month:
> January recorded the lowest sales, likely due to post-holiday financial recovery among customers and reduced consumer spending.

* Top and Bottom Performing Cities:

> San Francisco emerged as the city with the highest sales, indicating a strong customer base or high purchasing power.

> Austin, on the other hand, recorded the lowest sales, suggesting either lower demand or fewer promotional activities.

* Peak Sales Hours:

> Sales peaked during 10:30 AM – 1:00 PM and 6:00 PM – 8:00 PM.

>> These time slots are ideal for scheduling digital ads and promotional displays to maximize visibility and conversion.

* Frequently Bought Together:
> The combination of Google Phone and Wired Headphones was commonly purchased together, suggesting bundling opportunities or cross-promotion strategies.

* Top-Selling Product:
> AAA Batteries (4-pack) were the most frequently sold item. The likely reason is their low unit price, making them a common add-on or impulse purchase.

* Price vs Quantity Relationship:
> An inverse moderate correlation was observed between Quantity Ordered and Mean Prices, indicating that lower-priced items tend to be ordered in larger quantities.
